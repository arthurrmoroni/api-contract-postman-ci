# API Contract Testing – Postman + Newman + CI

This project is a portfolio example focused on **API contract testing**, simulating a food management / backoffice system (ZS-like context).

The goal is to validate API reliability, response structure, and stability using automated tests.

## What is covered
- Contract validation (required fields and structure)
- Status code assertions
- Basic performance assertions with CI-safe thresholds
- Environment-based configuration
- Automated execution via CI

## Target API
Public API used for realistic testing:
- **Open Food Facts API**
  - Get product by barcode
  - Search products (catalog)
